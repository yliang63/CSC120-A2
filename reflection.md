What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The attributor of class resaleshop does not work. So I add self to many of them and then it works. However, I don't really know why. I should self-study about that. For the "main" method in two class. I keep forgetting the it should start from the same line with class. It is useful to ask question and listen to other people's questions. I really appreciate people who help me during this homework. I should ask questions next time when having another project.
